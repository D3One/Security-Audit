## üìñ Overview

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and toolkit, accumulated through hands-on experience in infrastructure security auditing. It contains custom scripts, configuration templates, and checklists designed to assess the security posture of various technologies, including:

*   **Operating Systems:** Windows Server, Linux distributions
*   **Databases:** Microsoft SQL Server, SAP HANA/ASE
*   **Web Servers:** Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, IIS
*   **Network Services:** Active Directory, DNS, DHCP
*   **Middleware and Applications**

_The tools here are provided as-is to help security professionals, students, and enthusiasts understand common audit procedures and learn how to build their own automation._

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Inside?

The repository is organized into directories for different technologies:

*   `/windows-audit/`
    *   PowerShell scripts for auditing Active Directory, Group Policy, OS hardening, and service configurations.
    *   Example: `Invoke-WindowsBaselineAudit.ps1` - A comprehensive check for common misconfigurations.
*   `/linux-audit/`
    *   Bash scripts and configuration checkers for common Linux security benchmarks (inspired by CIS).
*   `/sap-audit/`
    *   SQL scripts and notes for reviewing SAP security parameters, user authorizations, and system configurations.
*   `/mssql-audit/`
    *   T-SQL scripts to check for weak SQL Server settings, excessive permissions, and trace flags.
*   `/web-server-audit/`
    *   Templates and scripts for reviewing Apache/HTTPD and IIS configuration files for security issues.
*   `/templates/`
    *   Custom templates for audit reports, findings databases, and checklists.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A test/lab environment. **DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS WITHOUT PROPER APPROVAL AND TESTING.**
*   Appropriate permissions on the target systems you are authorized to audit.
*   Basic knowledge of:
    *   PowerShell (for Windows scripts)
    *   Bash (for Linux scripts)
    *   SQL (for database scripts)
*   A text editor or IDE to review and modify the code before execution.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/D3One/Security-Audit.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the directory of the tool you wish to use.
3.  **CRITICAL:** Open the script in a text editor. Carefully review the code.
    *   Understand what it does.
    *   Change any hard-coded variables (like usernames, IP addresses, paths) to match your test environment.
    *   Check for compatibility with your target's software version.

### Basic Usage

1.  **Adapt:** Modify the script for your specific environment and the version of the software you are auditing.
2.  **Test:** Run the script in a safe, isolated lab environment first to verify its functionality and output.
3.  **Execute:** Run the script on your authorized target system. Most scripts will output results to the console or a log file.
    *   **Example for a PowerShell script:**
        ```powershell
        # Review and adapt the script first!
        .\Invoke-WindowsBaselineAudit.ps1 -ComputerName "LAB-SERVER01" -OutputFormat CSV
        ```
